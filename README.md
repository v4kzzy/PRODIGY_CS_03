# Cybersecurity Tools Suite 🛡️

This repository contains two Python-based cybersecurity tools developed to demonstrate encryption algorithms and password security assessment. Both tools feature a modern Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with `ttkbootstrap`.

## 📂 Included Tools

### 1. Image Encryption Tool 🔐
A tool that encrypts and decrypts images using pixel manipulation.
- **Method:** Uses bitwise XOR operations combined with RGB channel swapping.
- **Key Feature:** Supports text-based keys (e.g., "labubu") by converting ASCII values to a numeric key.
- **Modes:** Encrypt (scrambles the image) and Decrypt (restores the original).

### 2. Password Strength Checker 🔑
A real-time password assessment tool.
- **Visual Feedback:** Features a dynamic gauge (meter) that fills up as you type.
- **Criteria:** Checks for length (8+), uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- **Scoring:** Gives a score from 0-100% with color-coded feedback (Red/Orange/Green).
